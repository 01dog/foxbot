# foxbot
this bot is an amalgam of several other discord bots and things ive found  
im posting this for others to reference since there are so many different ways to build bots and i've found this to be my preferred way  
make sure to edit config_default.json and rename to config.json if you ever want to use this  
also make sure to edit the bot_default.agent (and rename it) for the reddit bot. refer to the graw tutorial for some more info here: [link](https://turnage.gitbooks.io/graw/content/chapter1.html)
